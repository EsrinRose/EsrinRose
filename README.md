- Hi, I’m @EsrinRose
- I was inspired by many things in my life when I was little, which led to bits of cut up paper with wasted tape (which I would sneak from the cabinet that was suppost to be child proof) stuck on to the bare carpet.
The phases i went tbrough of art and creativity were so obvious that even now I know the exact order. age 4- figureing out the child locks. age 5- mixing random spices (including peper which didnt go so well).
age 6- mixing shampoo and condintioner.
